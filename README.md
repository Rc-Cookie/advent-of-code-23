# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to (some of) the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles of 2023.

I am using my [Advent-of-Code-Runner](https://github.com/Rc-Cookie/advent-of-code-runner) package
which automatically downloads input, submits output and generally simplifies development with some
commonly used helper functions. Feel free to check it out yourself if you are using Java!
